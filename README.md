##Maina in the Morning Count the Cash Simulation
file: count_the_cash.py

This function serves to demonstrate that you must always change your initial choice immediately after maina reveals which of the 3 numbers is not correct
	
My simulation demonstrated that those who 'STICK THEIR ORIGINAL ANSWER' will win only 33% of the time, while those who SWITCH to the other remaining option have a 67% chance of winning
	
###ASSUMPTIONS
Currently we are assuming Maina will never tell you if your initial answer is incorrect, If that ever happens, its okay, but it's not part of the scenario we are simulating

This is a classic probability challenge also known as the MONTY HALL PROBLEM
